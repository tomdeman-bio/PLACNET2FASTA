## This script needs three input files

### 1. The placnet .net.csv file 
### 2. A FASTA header file containing sequence headers from plasmids only (example header file is included with this script)
### 3. The assembled contig or scaffold file that was used as input for placnet

### The FASTA header file can be generated using “grep ‘>’ NCBI-plasmid.fasta > header-file.txt”
